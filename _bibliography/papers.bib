	abstract = {Abstract Transcription factors show rapid and reversible binding to chromatin in living cells, and transcription occurs in sporadic bursts, but how these phenomena are related is unknown. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo single-molecule imaging approaches, we directly correlated binding of the Gal4 transcription factor with the transcriptional bursting kinetics of the Gal4 target genes GAL3 and GAL10 in living yeast cells. We find that Gal4 dwell time sets the transcriptional burst size. Gal4 dwell time depends on the affinity of the binding site and is reduced by orders of magnitude by nucleosomes. Using a novel imaging platform called orbital tracking, we simultaneously tracked transcription factor binding and transcription at one locus, revealing the timing and correlation between Gal4 binding and transcription. Collectively, our data support a model in which multiple RNA polymerases initiate transcription during one burst as long as the transcription factor is bound to DNA, and bursts terminate upon transcription factor dissociation.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes drastically limit transcription factor (TF) occupancy, while pioneer transcription factors (PFs) somehow circumvent this nucleosome barrier. In this study, we compare nucleosome binding of two conserved S. cerevisiae basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs, Cbf1 and Pho4. A cryo-EM structure of Cbf1 in complex with the nucleosome reveals that the Cbf1 HLH region can electrostatically interact with exposed histone residues within a partially unwrapped nucleosome. Single-molecule fluorescence studies show that the Cbf1 HLH region facilitates efficient nucleosome invasion by slowing its dissociation rate relative to DNA through interactions with histones, whereas the Pho4 HLH region does not. In vivo studies show that this enhanced binding provided by the Cbf1 HLH region enables nucleosome invasion and ensuing repositioning. These structural, single-molecule, and in vivo studies reveal the mechanistic basis of dissociation rate compensation by PFs and how this translates to facilitating chromatin opening inside cells.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes restrict the occupancy of most transcription factors (TF) by reducing binding and accelerating dissociation, while a small group of TFs have high affinities to nucleosome-embedded sites and facilitate nucleosome displacement. To understand this process mechanistically, we investigated two Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFs, Reb1 and Cbf1. We show that these factors bind to their sites within nucleosomes with similar binding affinities as to naked DNA, trapping a partially unwrapped nucleosome without histone eviction. Both the binding and dissociation rates of Reb1 and Cbf1 are significantly slower at the nucleosomal sites relative to those for naked DNA, demonstrating that the high affinities are achieved by increasing the dwell time on nucleosomes in order to compensate for reduced binding. Reb1 also shows slow migration rate in the yeast nuclei. These properties are similar to those of human pioneer factors (PFs), suggesting that the mechanism of nucleosome targeting is conserved from yeast to humans.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors (TF) require access to target sites within nucleosomes to initiate transcription. The target site position within the nucleosome significantly inﬂuences TF occupancy, but how is not quantitatively understood. Using ensemble and singlemolecule ﬂuorescence measurements, we investigated the targeting and occupancy of the transcription factor, Gal4, at different positions within the nucleosome. We observe a dramatic decrease in TF occupancy to sites extending past 30 base pairs (bp) into the nucleosome which cannot be explained by changes in the TF dissociation rate or binding site orientation. Instead, the nucleosome unwrapping free energy landscape is the primary determinant of Gal4 occupancy by reducing the Gal4 binding rate. The unwrapping free energy landscape deﬁnes two distinct regions of accessibility and kinetics with a boundary at 30 bp into the nucleosome where the inner region is over 100-fold less accessible. The Gal4 binding rate in the inner region no longer depends on its concentration because it is limited by the nucleosome unwrapping rate, while the frequency of nucleosome rewrapping decreases because Gal4 exchanges multiple times before the nucleosome rewraps. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of the nucleosome unwrapping free energy landscape on TF occupancy and dynamics that ultimately inﬂuences transcription initiation.},

	abstract = {The spliceosome is a megadalton protein-RNA complex which removes introns from pre-mRNA, yet the dynamic early assembly steps have not been structurally resolved. Specifically, how the spliceosome selects the correct 3’ splice site (3’SS) amongst highly similar non-functional sites is not known. Here, we develop a kinetic model of splice site selection based on single-molecule U2AF heterodimer imaging in vitro and in vivo. The model successfully predicts alternative splicing patterns and indicates that 3’SS selection occurs while U2AF is in complex with the spliceosome, not during initial binding. This finding indicates the spliceosome operates in a ‘partial’ kinetic proofreading regime, catalyzed in part by the helicase DDX42, which increases selectivity to the underlying U2AF binding site while still allowing for efficient forward progression.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms underlying molecular targeting to mitochondria remain enigmatic, yet this process is crucial for normal cellular function. The RNA binding proteins U2AF1/2 form a heterodimer (U2AF) that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, regulating splicing in the nucleus and translation in the cytoplasm. Our study identifies an unexpected role for U2AF in mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that U2AF interacts with nuclear-transcribed mitochondrial mRNAs and proteins, inhibits translation, localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and regulates mRNA localization to mitochondria. Moreover, an oncogenic point-mutation in U2AF1(S34F) disrupts this regulation, leading to altered mitochondrial structure, increased translation, and OXPHOS-dependent metabolic rewiring, recapitulating changes observed in bone marrow progenitors from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. These findings reveal a non-canonical role for U2AF, where it modulates multiple aspects of mitochondrial function by regulating the translation and mitochondrial targeting of nuclear-encoded mRNAs.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes, the fundamental organizing units of eukaryotic genomes, contain ∼146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone H3–H4 tetramer and two histone H2A–H2B dimers. Converting nucleosomes into hexasomes by removal of a H2A–H2B dimer is an important regulatory event, but its regulation and functional consequences are not well-understood. To investigate the inﬂuence of hexasomes on DNA accessibility, we used the property of the Widom-601 Nucleosome Positioning Sequence (NPS) to form homogeneously oriented hexasomes in vitro. We ﬁnd that DNA accessibility to transcription factors (TF) on the hexasome H2A–H2B distal side is identical to naked DNA, while the accessibility on the H2A–H2B proximal side is reduced by 2-fold, which is due to a 2-fold reduction in hexasome unwrapping probability. We then determined that a 23 bp region of the Widom-601 NPS is responsible for forming homogeneously oriented hexasomes. Analysis of published ChIP-exo data of hexasome containing genes identiﬁed two DNA sequence motifs that correlate with hexasome orientation in vivo, while ExoIII mapping studies of these sequences revealed they generate homogeneously oriented hexasomes in vitro. These results indicate that hexasome orientation, which is inﬂuenced by the underlying DNA sequence in vivo, is important for modulating DNA accessibility to regulate transcription.},
