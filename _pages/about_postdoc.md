<strong>Bixuan Wang, Ph.D</strong> recieved her PhD from the University of Maryland in 2024 working with Steve Mount and Dan Larson to develop new computational approaches to decode splicing regulation. She spent the next year-and-a-half as a postdoc in Chris Burge's lab at MIT. Her primary research interest is identifying signals from biological sequences that may explain the mechanisms of different forms of RNA splicing. She is currently using mixture models and machine learning algorithms to analyze non-canonical RNA splicing sites and predict RNA-binding proteins involved in the process.
