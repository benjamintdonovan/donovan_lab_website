<strong>Ben Donovan, Ph.D. </strong> is an assistant professor of physics at the University of California, Riverside. He did his PhD research in [Michael Poirer's lab](https://u.osu.edu/poirierlab/) at the Ohio State University where he used single-molecule approaches to probe the mechanisms by which transcription factors gain access to their sites in chromatin. After graduating, he was a postdoctoral fellow in [Dan Larson's lab](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/daniel-r-larson/) at the National Cancer Institute where he studied the dynamic quality control mechanisms of splicing. At UCR, the lab seeks to advance single-molecule approaches to directly visualize spliceosome assembly in cells and to relate these kinetic mechanisms to downstream gene expression.
