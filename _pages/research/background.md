## 1) Gene Regulation via RNA Processing
Gene expression describes how genetic information stored in DNA is used to create proteins, which carry out most cellular functions. However, among all domains of life (from humans to bacteria), a protein is not made directly from DNA. Instead, proteins are translated from an RNA template; a short-lived version of the DNA sequence subject to extensive regulation. For example, human RNAs contain long stretches of sequences that must be removed ('spliced out') before being translated into a protein. In this way, RNA splicing has considerable potential for regulation.

## 2) The Spliceosome
While there are many protein complexes that act on RNA to regulate its function, perhaps none are more central to RNA processing than the spliceosome, which is responsible for identifying and removing non-functional regions of the gene called introns. The spliceosome is a massive complex, consisting of hundreds of proteins that must assemble from scratch during every splicing reaction.

## 3) Open Questions
Due to its numerous components, the spliceosome has been tough to study! Despite over 40 years of work, the spliceosome has never been reconstituted from purified proteins. Furthermore, even in extracts, splicing is very slow and correct splicing of introns longer than a few kilobases has not been achieved. 

Our lab will dissect the <strong>temporal regulation of splicing in live cells</strong> by combining imaging-based approaches with classical biochemistry and sequencing assays. The unifying motivation is that gene expression is fundamentally regulated by poorly understood kinetic processes. By emphasizing kinetic measurements, we aim to reveal mechanisms and new angles for therapeutic intervention.
