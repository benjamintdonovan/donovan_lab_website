## A) Lifetimes, States, and Fidelity
While structural biology has resolved many spliceosome intermediates, their time scales are largely unknown. We visualize spliceosome assembly and link state lifetimes to downstream gene expression and fidelity checkpoints.

## B) New Single-Molecule Tools to Visualize Distinct Spliceosome States

## C) Direct Visualization of Alternative Splicing Regulation in Single Cells
- Measure lifetimes of distinct spliceosome states in cells and relate them to gene expression.  
- Readouts: alternative 3′ splice sites, kinetics, viability.  
- Goal: reveal how mutations rewire kinetic checkpoints.
